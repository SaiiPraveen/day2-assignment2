          <p>I like to read Indian blogs because I can relate myself with them. It’s not like I do not read other bloggers but still love to read Indians.

            <h2>This is my recent blog:</h2>
            <p>We’ve created this article with a simple mission, to share with new bloggers some examples of successful and popular blogs on the web.<br>Hopefully, these niche blog examples will motivate you to start your own blog. </p>
            <p> However, the quality of the content itself is sometimes not enough, meaning that most popular blogs also pay attention to design. <>
            <p>We chose some of the most currently popular niches and selected several blog examples for each niche. We researched every blog to learn more about CMS’es and the themes that they’re using. Finally, we included the sources of income for every blog, which can help you to understand how blogs make money..</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for the best blog examples to inspire you, you’re on the right page. We have covered a wide variety of top personal blogs and sorted them by niches. Read on!</p>
